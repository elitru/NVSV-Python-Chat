# Python Chat

This app is divided into two parts, the front- and backend respectively. The backend of the application was developed by Martin Linhard (@realSuffix) while the frontend was taken care of by Elias Trummer (@elitru).

## Starting the application

### Backend
After installing the `websockets` python library, the application can be started with `python backend/main.py`.

### Frontend
Since the frontend was developed in plain HTML/CSS, the index.html file can be opened using any modern web browser.
